A simple program with two versions, the code are designed slightly differently. Mainly to show:

1. fundamentals of my programming
2. clarity, design of, and how maintainable is the code
3. time complexity of the algorithm
4. how I name variables and functions

Please see the Process Documentation v1, and/or screenshots of both the versions.
