Two versions of a same program. At first glance, main difference is the interface (or look), the code are actually designed differently. Currently improving:

1. Fixing validating integer input.
2. Replacing scanf with a different approach.
3. Cleaning up unnecessary functions and variables.

Please see the Process Documentation v1, and/or screenshots of both the versions too.
